## Summary
Day 1: This course taught me that I have lots to do before I even get start with trying to hack a box. I was a little disappointed that the TryHackMe platform is hidden behind such a paywall. Today I set up Kali Linux on a VirtualMachine. We will see if my computer can handle this! I have heard Kali Linux a lot and I heard it is a very good tool for all things pen testing. It is also a way to get around the paywall that THM has for hacking in their browser. I think its a good thing to learn to use anyway.

## Techniques / Enumeration
Still way too early for anything here. I guess just keep an open mind and know that you are going to have to watch a lot of youtube videos to master this stuff.
